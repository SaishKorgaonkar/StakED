# StakED - The On-Chain Confidence Market 🏆

### Stake on Performance. Earn on Results.

**StakED** is a decentralized, gamified platform that lets students stake on academic performance using **PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin** and earn rewards based on real, verified results. It brings the transparency of **Blockscout**, the stability of **PYUSD**, and the reliability of **Hardhat 3** into one on-chain ecosystem that rewards learning through incentives.

### 🚨 For Judging Access

For the judging process, we’ve provided **verifier access** inside the app. One account only provides access to one dashboard.
You will need **two MetaMask accounts**:
- One to log in as a **student**
- One to log in as a **verifier**

"Connect with metamask" button grants student access
"Verifier access" button grants verifier access

Once logged in this cannot be changed. This ensures safety for the website

ALSO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYUSD IN YOUR METAMASK ACCOUNT, THIS WILL BE ESSENTIAL IF YOU WANT TO STAKE

A quick-access button for the **Verifier Dashboard** is available on the landing page for easy testing.

| **Payments Applicability** | How does it address real-world payment challenges? | PYUSD eliminates volatility, allowing students worldwide to earn real-value incentives for performance, bridging **DeFi** and **education**. |
| **Novelty** | How unique is the concept? | StakED introduces an on-chain education staking platform that uses a stablecoin (PYUSD) to enable transparent, performance-based academic rewards. |
| **UX** | Is the experience intuitive? | Clean ShadCN + Tailwind with a neo-brutalism styled interface with transparent staking flow and Blockscout-linked transaction views. |
| **Open-Source** | Public and composable code? | 100% open-source on GitHub. |
| **Business Plan** | Can this evolve into a viable business? | StakED can scale into a **learning incentive platform** for schools or edtechs using PYUSD-based micro-rewards to incentivze studying. |

> 🧠 **In essence:** “PYUSD brings PayPal’s trust and stability into DeFi staking, finally making real-world, dollar-backed incentives possible for education.”

| **SDK Integration** | Did the app use Blockscout’s SDK meaningfully? | Yes — real-time transaction history, win-rate tracking, toast notifications, and on-chain analytics powered by the SDK & API (v2). |
| **Transparency** | Are transactions verifiable? | All staking, claim, and exam interactions link directly to Blockscout explorer pages. |
| **Originality** | How unique is the use case? | Combining education, staking, and on-chain analytics. |

> 🔍 **“Blockscout makes StakED fully transparent — users can verify every stake, payout, and result.”**

---

### 🛠️ **Hardhat 3**

| Criteria | Description | How StakED Satisfies |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Version Compliance** | Uses Hardhat 3.0.0+? | Yes — explicitly built with v3 and its new compiler/runtime. |
| **Testing** | Are tests implemented with Hardhat 3? | Yes — smart contract deployment and staking flow tested using Solidity test framework. |
| **Performance** | Uses Hardhat’s new features? | Verified faster compile & local simulation with Hardhat Network. |
| **Reliability** | Is Hardhat integral to the build process? | Entire contract lifecycle — from compilation to testnet deployment — runs through Hardhat scripts. |

> 🧱 **“Every contract in StakED was built and validated with Hardhat 3 — ensuring stable, production-grade deployment.”**

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description | On-Chain/Off-Chain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Staking** | Students lock tokens to bet on their own success (e.g., scoring $\ge 75\%$ on an exam). | Hybrid (Token Transfer $\rightarrow$ On-Chain Stake) |
| **Peer Staking** | Students can stake on the expected performance of their classmates, creating a dynamic, peer-driven confidence market. | Hybrid (Token Transfer $\rightarrow$ On-Chain Stake) |
| **Verifier Integrity** | Verifiers can create exams, set deadlines, and manage classes. The platform uses a **commit-reveal** process for grading to prevent results tampering. | On-Chain (Verifier Registry, Exam Management) |
| **Prediction-Based Payout** | Winners are determined by accuracy: **actual score $\ge$ predicted score**. Forfeited stakes from losers are distributed among winning stakers. | On-Chain |
| **PYUSD as Staking Token** | **PayPal USD (PYUSD)** is used as the base staking and reward token, providing a stable, regulated asset for financial incentives. | On-Chain |

## 🏗️ Smart Contract Architecture

The core functionality is managed by modular Solidity contracts, emphasizing separation of concerns for clarity and security.

| Contract | Purpose | Key Roles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ExamStaking.sol` | Main interaction point for staking, grading, and reward payout. | `Owner`, `Verifier`, `Student` |
| `VerifierRegistry.sol` | Manages the list of authorized teacher/examiner wallet addresses. | `onlyAdmin`, `isVerifier` |
| `StudentRegistry.sol` | Manages registration of student wallet addresses. | `onlyAdmin`, `isRegistered` |

### Key Functions (in `ExamStaking.sol`)

| Function | Purpose | On-Chain Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `stake(..., uint256 predictedScore)` | Transfers PYUSD and records the stake on-chain along with the expected score. | `pyusd.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount)` |
| `setStudentScores(..., uint256[] scores)` | **Verifier** submits final scores. The contract determines winners based on `actual_score >= predicted_score`. | Sets `e.actualScores` and `e.isWinner` |
| `distributeRewards(bytes32 examId)` | Finalizes the exam and initiates the reward pool distribution logic. | Sets `e.finalized = true` |
| `claim(bytes32 examId)` | Calculates and sends the appropriate reward (original stake + proportional share of loser pool) to the staker. | `pyusd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, finalAmount)` |

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started (Development)

The project is structured into three main directories: `contracts`, `backend`, and `frontend`.

### 1. Smart Contracts Setup (`contracts/`)

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd contracts
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Configure**: Set up your `.env` file with your **Sepolia RPC URL** and private key for deployment.
3.  **Deployment**: Deploy the core contracts, including `VerifierRegistry`, `StudentRegistry`, and `ExamStaking`, to the Sepolia testnet.
    ```bash
    npm run deploy:sepolia 
    # Recommended: npm run deploy:final to use the final prediction-based contract
    ```

### 2. Backend Setup (`backend/`)

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Configure**: Create a `.env` file for **`MONGO_URI`**, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, and your Sepolia RPC/Private Key.
3.  **Run**: Start the API server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### 3. Frontend Setup (`frontend/`)

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Configure**: Update environment variables (`.env` file) with deployed contract addresses and the backend API URL.
3.  **Run**: Start the React application.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
